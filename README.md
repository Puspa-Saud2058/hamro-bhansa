#Hamro-Bhansa- an Food Ordering webapp

Hamro-Bhansa food ordering app allows users to view menus, place orders, and have food delivered to their location. Users typically create accounts, choose dishes, customize orders, and make payments through the e-sewa app. The app facilitates the entire food delivery process, enhancing convenience for customers and providing a platform for restaurants to expand their reach. I am confident that this project will offer a concise overview of the functioning of food-ordering websites, providing insight into how they operate in today's digital landscape.
